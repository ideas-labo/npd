## **Anomalous Performance of `-O0`**

In GCC 12.0, we observed that for certain test cases, the `-O0` optimization level outperformed `-O1`, but this phenomenon was not observed in GCC 9.2. Due to limited resources, we only reported anomalies that consistently appeared in repeated tests. System noise cannot be completely ruled out. The Docker image used for testing is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/anonymicse2021/gcc_inputs). Test data are as follows:
