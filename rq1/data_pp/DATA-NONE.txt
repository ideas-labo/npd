Note : Disabling the shutdown port works well when Tomcat is started using Apache Commons Daemon (running as a service on Windows or with jsvc on un*xes). It cannot be used when running Tomcat with the standard shell scripts though, as it will prevent shutdown.bat|.sh and catalina.bat|.sh from stopping it gracefully.	0
adaptation_masterx_shared_names	For each master transaction (i.e., the HTTP request and response sequence, including all related ICAP and eCAP exchanges), Squid maintains a table of metadata.
